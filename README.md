# hello-world
This is my introduction to git and Git-Hub.  The repository is to explore Git.
My name is Paul and I am a database developer who is new to the whole repository bit.
My company has recently done a deep dive into Agile development, and we want to explore continuous integration technologies for database development.

So far I really like Git and GitHub!
